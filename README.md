### **Transformer Architecture from Scratch**

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of the Transformer architecture, built from the ground up. 
The Transformer model, introduced in the seminal paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), has become the backbone of modern natural language processing (NLP) and sequence-to-sequence models.
This project demonstrates the key components of the Transformer model, with detailed modular implementations.

### **Features**

- Modular implementation of core Transformer components:
  - **Attention Mechanisms** (Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Multi-Head Attention)
  - **Encoder and Decoder Modules**
  - **Positional Encoding**
  - **Layer Normalization**
- Implementation of the complete Transformer model in `transformer.ipynb`.
- Ready for extension to tasks like translation or text classification.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - Implements scaled dot-product attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.

2. **Positional Encoding**:
   - Adds positional information to input embeddings since the Transformer lacks inherent sequence order.

3. **Encoder**:
   - Stacks self-attention and feed-forward layers to encode the input sequence.

4. **Decoder**:
   - Uses masked self-attention and encoder-decoder attention to generate outputs, one step at a time.

5. **Normalization**:
   - Applies layer normalization to ensure stable training.

### **Usage**

This implementation can serve as:

- A foundational codebase for understanding Transformer models.
- A starting point for implementing NLP tasks like text translation, summarization, or classification.
- A customizable framework for experimenting with new architectures or modifications to the Transformer model.
